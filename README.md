# SoftUni-Courses


### In this repository you will find different courses, that I've been through, represented from Software University (shortly SoftUni) !

 - ["SoftUni Programming Basics - Python Certificate"](https://softuni.bg/certificates/details/137655/7f3b88f8 "SoftUni PB Certificate")

 
### Every course has a different lectures, each lecture is divided into three divisions of complexity:

* labs - easiest
* exercise - more complex 
* extra - most complex

### Each division has a tasks document or it is commented out in the code !
